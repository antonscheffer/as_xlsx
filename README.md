# as_xlsx
generate an Excel xlsx file from an Oracle database. Or read data from a xlsx.

This is an updated version of the original, still available at the [AMIS blog](https://technology.amis.nl/languages/oracle-plsql/create-an-excel-file-with-plsql/). Original is at version 20, this one is version 40, so there are some improvements. But I must admit, last time I did change something is several years ago. I can't recall what and why.

And this version does include an updated (finally using XMLtable :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) version of [as_read_xlsx](https://technology.amis.nl/languages/oracle-plsql/read-a-excel-xlsx-with-plsql/)
